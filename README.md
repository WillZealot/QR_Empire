## Decription
This application focused on creating a web page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API. Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine. Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database. Using HTML and CSS helped us create our wireframe of the webpage. We also used an API from Qrickit site to get a QR Code image which matches with the link you want to create. So user can pass that QR Code image to their customer for open the website by scanning that QR Code image.
